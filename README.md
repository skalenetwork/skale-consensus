![Build and test skale-consensus](https://github.com/skalenetwork/skale-consensus/workflows/Build%20and%20test%20skale-consensus/badge.svg)

SKALE consensus utilizes multiple block proposers.  Block proposers distribute proposals to nodes and collect a BLS-signature based data availability proofs. An Asynchronous Binary Byzantine Agreement is then executed for each block proposal to reach consensus on whether it is data-available.  If multiple block proposals are known to be data-available, a BLS-based common coin is used to select the winning proposal that is committed to the chain.

SKALE Consensus uses an Asynchronous Binary Byzantine Agreement (ABBA) protocol. The current implementation uses ABBA from Mostefaoui _et al._ In general, any ABBA protocol can be used so long as it has the following properties:

-   Network model: protocol assumes asynchronous network messaging model.
-   Byzantine nodes: protocol assumes less than 1/3 of nodes are Byzantine.
-   Initial vote: protocol assumes each node makes an initial _yes_ or _no_ vote.
-   Consensus vote: protocol terminates with consensus vote of either _yes_ or _no_. Where consensus vote is _yes_, it is guaranteed that at least one honest node voted _yes_.

## An important note about production readiness:

The SKALE consensus is still in active development and contains bugs. This software should be regarded as _alpha software_. Development is still subject to competing the specification, security hardening, further testing, and breaking changes.  **This consensus engine has not yet been reviewed or audited for security.** Please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting policies.


## Installation Requirements

SKALE consensus has been built and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and later.

The preferred build environment is currenty Ubuntu 22.04.

Ensure that the required packages are installed by executing:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -yq libprocps-dev gcc-9 g++-9 valgrind gawk sed libffi-dev ccache \
    libgoogle-perftools-dev flex bison yasm texinfo autotools-dev automake \
    python3 python3-pip cmake libtool build-essential pkg-config autoconf wget \
    git  libargtable2-dev libmicrohttpd-dev libhiredis-dev redis-server openssl \
    libssl-dev doxygen libgcrypt20-dev
```

### Building from source on Ubuntu (Development)

Steps to build from source:

```bash
# clone repo
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/skalenetwork/skale-consensus.git
# build dependencies
cd scripts && ./build_deps.sh 
 # Configure the Cmake build.
cd .. && cmake . -Bbuild
# now run hunter bug workaround
mkdir -p "${HOME}"/.hunter/_Base/Download/crc32c/1.0.5/dc7fa8c/ && wget -O "${HOME}"/.hunter/_Base/Download/crc32c/1.0.5/dc7fa8c/hunter-1.0.5.tar.gz https://github.com/hunter-packages/crc32c/archive/refs/tags/hunter-1.0.5.tar.gz
#  now build all targets using all available CPU cores
cmake --build build -- -j$(nproc) 
```

### Running tests

Navigate to the testing directories and run `./consensusd .`
