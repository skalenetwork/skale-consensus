![Build and test skale-consensus](https://github.com/skalenetwork/skale-consensus/workflows/Build%20and%20test%20skale-consensus/badge.svg)


Skale-consensus  is an **implementation of SKALE provable consensus spec** as described here https://docs.skale.network/technology/consensus-spec

Key features of of SKALE consensus

* **provably secure**
* **forkless**
* **single block finality** - blocks become immediately finalized once committed.
* **survives under arbitrarily long network distruptions and delays** by implementing asynchronous network model
* **multiple block proposers per block provide protocol stability** even if **some block proposers are down**

Read the spec for more exciting features. 

The consensus is under active improvement and research.


## Installation Requirements

SKALE consensus has been built and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and later.

The preferred build and execution environment is currenty Ubuntu 22.04.  

Ensure that the required packages are installed by executing:

```

### Building from source on Ubuntu (Development)

Steps to build from source:

```bash
# clone repo
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/skalenetwork/skale-consensus.git
# build dependencies
cd scripts && ./build_deps.sh 
 # Configure the Cmake build.
cd .. && cmake . -Bbuild
# now run hunter bug workaround
mkdir -p "${HOME}"/.hunter/_Base/Download/crc32c/1.0.5/dc7fa8c/ && wget -O "${HOME}"/.hunter/_Base/Download/crc32c/1.0.5/dc7fa8c/hunter-1.0.5.tar.gz https://github.com/hunter-packages/crc32c/archive/refs/tags/hunter-1.0.5.tar.gz
#  now build all targets using all available CPU cores
cmake --build build -- -j$(nproc) 
```

### Running tests

Navigate to the testing directories and run `./consensusd .`
