# Dynamic Oracle API

## 1. Intro

Dynamic Oracle is implemented by each SKALE chain. It is used to retrieve trusted data from websites and blockchains,
and then sign this data by multiple SKALE nodes.

### 1.1  Oracle request flow

When a user submit an Oracle request to retrieve data from a network endpoint:

* all nodes in a SKALE chain issue requests to retrieve data
* nodes compare data received and verify it is identical
* node create an OracleResult object
* at least 6 nodes must to sign the object
* OracleResult object is returned to the user (typically browser or mobile app)
* OracleResult can then be submitted to the SKALE chain and verified in Solidity.

### 1.2 JSON-RPC calls

The following two JSON-RPC calls are implemented by the SKALE node

* ```oracle_submitRequest``` - this one is used to submit the initial initial Oracle request. 
It returns a receipt object. 

* ```oracle_checkResult``` - this should be called periodically by passing the receipt 
(we recommend once per second) to check if the result is ready.

## 2. oracle_submitRequest

```string oracle_submitRequest( string oracleRequestSpect )```

This API call:
* takes OracleRequestSpec string as input
* returns a string receipt, that shall be used in ```oracle_checkResult```
* In case of an error, an error is returned (see Appendix A Errors)

## 3. oracle_checkResult

```string oracle_checkResult( string receipt )```

This API call

* takes string receipt as input
* returns OracleResult string if the result is ready

Otherwise, one of the following errors is returned


* ```ORACLE_RESULT_NOT_READY``` - OracleResult has not yet been produced 

* ```ORACLE_TIMEOUT``` OracleResult could not be obtained from the endpoint 
* and the timeout was reached


* ```ORACLE_NO_CONSENSUS``` - the endpoint returned different
data to different SKALE nodes, so no consensus could be reached on the data

## 4. OracleRequestSpec JSON format.

```OracleRequestSpec``` is a JSON string that is used by the client to 
initiate an Oracle request to a SKALE node.

Note: for efficiency, empty spaces and carriage returns are not allowed in OracleRequestSpec.  We do it to simplify
Solidity code that handles Oracle data.


There are two types of request specs. 

* Web spec is used to retrieve info from
web endpoints (http or https), 
* EthApi spec is used to retrieve info from Ethereum API.

Max size of OracleRequestSpec is 1024 bytes.

### 4.1.1 Web request spec

Web request spec is a JSON string that has the following elements

Required elements:

* ```cid```, uint64 - chain ID
* ```uri```, string - Oracle endpoint. Needs to start with "http://" or "https"

If uri starts with http:// or https:// then the information is obtained from the corresponding http:// or https:// endpoint. 
If uri is eth:// then information is obtained from the geth server that the SKALE node is connected to.
Max length of uri  is 1024 bytes.
* ```time```, uint64 - Linux time of request in ms.
* ```jsps```, array of strings - list of string JSON pointers to the data elements to be picked from server response. 
              The array must have from 1 to 32 elements. Max length of each pointer 1024 bytes. 
_See https://json.nlohmann.me/features/json_pointer/ for intro to JSON pointers.


* ```encoding```, string - the only currently supported encoding is```json```. ```abi``` will be supported in future releases. 

Optional elements:

* ```trims```, uint64 array - this is an array of trim values.
   It is used to trim endings of the strings in Oracle result.
   If ```trims``` array is provided, it has to provide trim value for
   each JSON pointer requested. The array size is then identical to ```jsps``` array size. For each ```jsp``` the trim value specifies how many characters are trimmed from the end of the string returned.

* ```post```, string
_if this element, then Oracle with use HTTP POST instead of HTTP GET (default).
   The value of the post element will be posted to the endpoint.

The SPEC shall also include the following element which must be the last element.

* ```pow```, string - uint64 proof of work that is used to protect against denial of service attacks.

Note: for each JSON pointer specified in the request, the Oracle
will

- pick the corresponding element from the endpoint response
- transform it to a string.
- If no such element exists, ```null``` will be returned.

### 4.1.2 EthApi request spec

EthApi request spec represents a JSON-API request to Ethereum API. 
Currently only ```eth_call``` is supported.

EthApi request spec is a JSON string that has the following elements

Required elements:

* ```cid```, uint64 - chain ID
* ```uri```, string - Oracle endpoint.
  _If uri starts with http:// or https:// then the information is obtained from the corresponding
   network endpoint. It is assumed that it supports ETH Api.
  _If uri is eth:// then information is obtained from the geth server that the SKALE node is connected to_.
  _Max length of uri string is 1024 bytes._
* ```time```, uint64 - Linux time of request in ms.
* ```ethApi```, string - this has to have value ```eth_call```
* ```params```, string - these are params to ```eth_call```
* ```encoding```, string - the only currently supported encoding is```json```. ```abi``` will be supported in future releases.
* ```pow```, string - uint64 proof of work that is used to protect against denial of service attacks.
  _Note: PoW must be the last element in JSON_


The SPEC shall also include the following element which must be the last element.

* ```pow```, string - uint64 proof of work that is used to protect against denial of service attacks.

Note: the ```params``` element  is a json array of two elements 

The first element of this array is an object
that must consist of the following four elements:

* ```from``` - from address
* ```to``` - to address
* ```data``` - data
* ```gas``` - gas limit

The second element of the array is string block number, which can
eiher be ```latest``` or a hex string

Here is an example of ```params``` element

```
"params":[{"to":"0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3",
"from":"0x9876543210987654321098765432109876543210",
"data":"0x893d20e8", "gas":0x100000},"latest"]
```


## 5. Examples of request specs

### 5.1 Web request using http GET 

HTTP get request that obtains current unix time and
day of the year from worldtimeapi.org.

```json
{"cid": 1, "uri": "http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Europe/Kiev","jsps":["/unixtime", "/day_of_year", "/xxx"],"trims":[1,1,1],"time":9234567,"encoding":"json","pow":53458}
```

Description:

- contact worldtimeapi.org endpoint.
- From the JSON result, pick ```unixtime```, ```day_of_year``` and ```xxx```
  elements.
- Convert each element to string.
- Trim one character from the end of each string.

### 5.2 Web request using http POST

HTTP post request that posts some data to endpoint

```json
{"cid": 1, "uri": "https://reqres.in/api/users", "jsps":["/id"],"time":9234567,"post":"some data","encoding":"json","pow":1735}
```


### 5.3 EthApi request 

EthApi request doing ```eth_call``` on a smart contract

```json
{"cid":1,"uri":"https://mygeth.com:1234","ethApi":"eth_call","params":[{"from":"0x9876543210987654321098765432109876543210","to":"0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3","data":"0x893d20e8","gas":"0x100000"},"latest"],"encoding":"json","time":1681494451895,"pow":61535}
```    


## 6. Proof of work computation

The proof of work is an integer value that is selected by
iterating from 0 until the following pseudocode returns true

```c++
bool verifyPow() {
   auto hash = SHA3_256(specString);
   return ~u256(0) / hash > u256(10000);
}
```

Here ~ is bitwise NOT and u256 is unsigned 256 bit number.

specStr is the full JSON spec string, starting from ```{``` and ending with
```}```


## 7. OracleResult format

OracleResult copies JSON elements from the corresponding
OracleRequestSpec, stripping away the ```pow``` element.

Note: for efficiency, empty spaces and carriage returns are not present in OracleResult.  We do it to simplify
Solidity code that handles Oracle data.


It then appends to the following elements

1. ```rslts ``` - array of string results. Note for EthAPI ```results``` is a single element array that includes
                  the hex encoded ```DATA``` string which is returned by eth_call. 
2. ```sigs``` - array of ECDSA signatures where ```t``` signatures are not null.


Max size of OracleResult is 3072 bytes.

An example of Oracle result is provided below

```json
{"cid":1, "uri":"http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Europe/Kiev","jsps":["/unixtime", "/day_of_year", "/xxx"],"trims":[1,1,1],"time":1642521456593, "encoding":"json","rslts":["164252145","1",null],"sigs":["6d50daf908d97d947fdcd387ed4bdc76149b11766f455b31c86d5734f4422c8f","7d50daf908d97d947fdcd387ed4bdc76149b11766f455b31c86d5734f4422c8f","8d50daf908d97d947fdcd387ed4bdc76149b11766f455b31c86d5734f4422c8f","9d50daf908d97d947fdcd387ed4bdc76149b11766f455b31c86d5734f4422c8f","1050daf908d97d947fdcd387ed4bdc76149b11766f455b31c86d5734f4422c8f","6d50daf908d97d947fdcd387ed4bdc76149b11766f455b31c86d5734f4422c8f",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]}
